This repository holds my Brown CS honors thesis, where I used
[asymmetric tree lenses](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/lenses-toplas-final.pdf)
and
[constraint maintainers](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.47.3250&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
to build a model-view framework on top of
[Flapjax](http://flapjax-lang.org), a reactive JavaScript framework.

The code is slightly bitrotted---some of the tests involving stack
traces are failing---and I'm not sure if I'll ever have time to clean
it up. PRs are always appreciated. More to the point: imitiation is
the highest form of flattery. I made a toy... can you make a tool?
